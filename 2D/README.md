Approximating solutions to 2D CME for two species model of intrinsic transcriptional noise.


learning_env_affine.ipynb: Notebook in which to
  1. Generate and save training/testing/validation data
  2. Train model
  3. Visualize Model performance (plot PMFs, histograms of metric values, etc)
  4. Dependencies: need to import modules train_2D_rt_v2.py and tools_2D_rt_v2.py
 

`train_2D_rt_v2.py`: module with functions for generating data and training model

`tools_2D_rt_v2.py`: module with functions for plotting/visualizing performance

`training_data/`: directory for training data; empty on github for now
